# Front End Practice

I completed multiple assignments in the Free Code Camp Academy while learning Front End development. I built four HTML and CSS pages, which were given to me as assignments. I used the latest web technologies such as HTML5 and CSS3 to create the user interface and was able to apply the knowledge and understanding I had gained during the course. I am proud of the projects I completed and I believe that this experience has helped me to further develop my skills in web design and Front End development.
